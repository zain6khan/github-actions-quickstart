Feedback for Github Actions Quickstart Guide:
Overall, as a newcomer, I found this quickstart guide to be a good starting point for understanding the basics of GitHub Actions and getting a simple workflow up and running. However, it could benefit from more references or links to additional documentation for newcomers who want to learn more about specific concepts like YAML syntax, available events, or job/step configurations.
